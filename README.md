# 🎬 Netflix Data Analysis & Recommendation System

This project analyzes the Netflix dataset and builds a content-based recommendation system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Netflix content
- Identify trends in movies, TV shows, countries, and genres
- Build a recommendation system based on content similarity

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF
- Cosine Similarity

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Movies dominate the Netflix catalog compared to TV shows
- The United States produces the largest amount of content
- Content production increased significantly after 2015

---

## 🤖 Recommendation System
A content-based recommendation system was developed using:
- TF-IDF vectorization of descriptions and genres
- Cosine similarity to measure similarity between titles

The system recommends similar titles based on textual content.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add user ratings
- Implement collaborative filtering
- Deploy as a web application
